As usual, it all started when i was a kid. The dream of flying had always been there, but it wasn't until my first flight in an airliner - a 737 if I remember correctly - that I got obsessed with airplanes and flying. I felt urged to build scale models, read books on airplanes and watching the movie "Top Gun" over and over again. Despite all this effort, I never became a US Navy fighter pilot. Heck, I didn't even make it to the Finnish Air Force. Instead, I fired heavy grenades in the forests of Western Finland during my service.

The dream of flying yet remained. As I was thrilled by military jets, I never took too much interest in free flight. A PPL license was way out of my reach financially, so becoming a pilot remained a dream for a long time. In 2005, I got a glider demo flight as a birthday present, and was hooked! The power of mother nature in free flight was mind-blowing. To actually feel and see the altitude gain even without looking at the instruments, really got to me. After a few years I was a proud, licensed glider pilot myself.

But life is an unpredictable series of events. One day you have a kid. The other, you find yourself living in a totally different part of the country. And then another kid exits the womb, making it even harder to find the time to spend a weekend at the closest flying site - which is a 100km away. So even with all the passion and desire, the everyday obligations and expenses caused this hobby to fade and fade, and eventually die out.

But finding the beauty of free flight really opened up a whole lot of options to get airborne. Hang gliding was a great interest for a while, but that also requires too expensive and bulky gear. And a site with towing equipment. This is not the Alps we're talking. I really cannot recall when Paragliding came into the picture. I think a friend of mine dreamed of trying it out sometime. But I also remember thinking "Nah, fixed wing is the way to go." Just like saying the only right way to fly is with power. Little did I know.
