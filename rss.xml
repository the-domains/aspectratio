            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Aspectratio</h1><p>As usual, it all started when i was a kid. The dream of flying had always been there, but it wasn't until my first flight in an airliner - a 737 if I remeber correctly - that I got obsessed with airplanes and flying. I felt urged to build scale models, read books on airplanes and watching the movie "Top Gun" over and over again. Despite all this effort, I never became a US Navy fighter pilot. Heck, I didn't even make it to the Finnish Air Force. Instead, I fired heavy grenades in the forests of Western Finland during my service.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/90bc0aa3-d06b-4e30-b0f7-33f9bb36d351.jpg"></article>]]></description>
